                        <h2>Introduction to HIPAA</h2>
                        <p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 is a federal law that established national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the HIPAA Privacy Rule to implement the requirements of HIPAA, and the Security Rule to establish a national set of security standards for protecting certain health information that is held or transferred in electronic form.</p>

                        <h2>What Does HIPAA Compliance Mean?</h2>
                        <p>HIPAA compliance means adhering to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. These rules establish the standards for the protection of certain health information. HIPAA compliance is required for covered entities (health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers) and their business associates (entities that perform certain functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity).</p>
                        
                        <p>The goal of HIPAA is to protect the privacy and security of protected health information (PHI) while allowing covered entities to adopt new technologies to improve the quality and efficiency of patient care.</p>

The proposed changes include strengthening individuals' rights to access their own health information, improving information sharing for care coordination and case management, facilitating family and caregiver involvement in the care of individuals experiencing emergencies or health crises, and enhancing flexibilities for disclosures in emergency or threatening circumstances.</p>
