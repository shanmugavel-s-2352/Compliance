# TAA Compliance Requirements

## Definition
TAA (Trade Agreements Act) compliance refers to a federal law that sets guidelines for government contracts and procurement. The purpose is to promote fair and open international trade and to ensure that products purchased by the U.S. government are manufactured in designated TAA-compliant countries.

## Key Requirements
1. **Designated Country Requirement**: Products must be manufactured or "substantially transformed" in the United States or a designated country with which the U.S. has a trade agreement.

2. **Substantial Transformation**: The majority of a product's components or value-added processes must be performed in a designated country.

3. **Record Keeping**: Maintain accurate records of products/services sold to the government and their country of origin, including a written compliance program.

4. **Domestic Sourcing Compliance**: Must also comply with Buy American Act (BAA) requirements that apply to government procurement, requiring a certain percentage of components to be sourced domestically.

## Designated Countries
- TAA-compliant countries include the United States, European Union countries, countries with free trade agreements with the U.S., and others like Taiwan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and Germany.
- Non-TAA-compliant countries include China, India, Russia, Vietnam, and Malaysia.

## Consequences of Non-Compliance
- Loss of government contracts and inability to sell to the federal government
