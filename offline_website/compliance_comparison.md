# Compliance Requirements Comparison Table

| Aspect | TAA | FedRAMP | FIPS 140-2 | CMMC |
|--------|-----|---------|------------|------|
| **Full Name** | Trade Agreements Act | Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program | Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 | Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification |
| **Governing Body** | General Services Administration (GSA) | Joint Authorization Board (JAB) | National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) | Department of Defense (DoD) |
| **Primary Purpose** | Ensure products purchased by U.S. government are manufactured in designated countries | Standardize security assessment for cloud services used by federal agencies | Specify security requirements for cryptographic modules | Protect Federal Contract Information (FCI) and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) |
| **What It Protects** | Government procurement integrity and fair trade | Federal data in cloud environments | Sensitive information processed by cryptographic modules | Defense industrial base information systems |
| **Compliance Levels** | Single level (compliant/non-compliant) | Three impact levels: Low, Moderate, High | Four security levels (1-4) | Three levels: Foundational (1), Advanced (2), Expert (3) |
| **Key Requirements** | • Products from designated countries<br>• Substantial transformation in designated country<br>• Record keeping<br>• Domestic sourcing compliance | • Readiness assessment<br>• Security assessment<br>• JAB authorization<br>• Agency authorization<br>• Continuous monitoring | • Approved cryptographic algorithms<br>• Module validation by NIST-approved lab<br>• Physical security measures<br>• Role-based authentication | • Level 1: 17 practices (FAR 52.204-21)<br>• Level 2: 110 practices (NIST SP 800-171)<br>• Level 3: 110+ practices plus 24 from NIST SP 800-172 |
| **Assessment Type** | Self-certification with potential audits | Third-party assessment | Third-party lab validation | • Level 1: Self-assessment<br>• Level 2: Self or C3PAO assessment<br>• Level 3: DIBCAC assessment |
| **Renewal/Monitoring** | Ongoing compliance monitoring | Continuous monitoring with annual assessments | No expiration, but reassessment for modifications | • Level 1: Annual self-assessment<br>• Level 2 & 3: Assessment every 3 years |
| **Primary Industries** | All federal contractors | Federal agencies and cloud service providers | Government, financial, healthcare, technology | Defense contractors and subcontractors |
| **Non-Compliance Consequences** | • Loss of government contracts<br>• Fines and penalties<br>• Suspension from government contracts | • Denial of ATO<br>• Inability to provide cloud services to federal agencies<br>• Potential contract termination | • Inability to sell cryptographic products to federal agencies<br>• Loss of market opportunities | • Ineligibility for DoD contracts<br>• Loss of existing contracts |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Moderate | High | High | Varies by level (Low to Very High) |
| **Cost Implications** | Moderate | High | Moderate to High | Varies by level (Low to High) |
