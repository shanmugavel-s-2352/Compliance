# FIPS 140-2 Compliance Requirements

## Definition
FIPS 140-2 (Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2) is a U.S. government standard that specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules used to protect sensitive information. It was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and was first published in 2001.

## Key Requirements

### Cryptography Algorithms
- Must use cryptographic algorithms approved by NIST
- Algorithms must provide sufficient strength to protect sensitive data
- Approved algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES), and Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA)

### Module Validation
- Cryptographic modules must be tested and evaluated by a third-party lab approved by NIST
- Validation verifies that the module meets security requirements outlined in FIPS 140-2
- Validated modules are listed on the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) website

### Security Levels
FIPS 140-2 defines four security levels, with each level building upon the requirements of the previous level:

1. **Level 1**: Basic security requirements for a cryptographic module
   - Physical barriers to protect from external tampering
   - Basic power-up self-tests

2. **Level 2**: Adds to Level 1 requirements
   - Role-based authentication
   - Only authorized individuals can access and perform certain functions

3. **Level 3**: Adds to Level 2 requirements
   - Physical tamper-resistance
   - Tamper-evident coatings and mechanisms to protect from physical attacks

4. **Level 4**: Adds to Level 3 requirements
   - Mitigation of other attacks (electromagnetic interference, electromagnetic compatibility)
   - Typically required for modules handling highly sensitive data

## Industry Applications
- **Government Agencies**: Required for all federal government agencies
- **Financial Institutions**: Required to protect financial data and payment transactions
- **Healthcare Organizations**: Essential for HIPAA compliance and protecting patient information
- **Technology Companies**: Used in products for secure data communication and storage

## Benefits of Compliance
1. Ensures secure government communications
2. Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access
3. Provides compliance with various regulations (PCI DSS, HIPAA)
4. Assures product quality and reliability
5. Offers global recognition and trust

## Implementation Best Practices
1. Identify cryptographic modules that require FIPS 140-2 validation
2. Select appropriate security level based on sensitivity of data
3. Use only validated cryptographic modules
4. Maintain proper documentation of compliance
5. Regularly update and patch cryptographic modules
6. Train staff on security protocols and procedures
